I am a third-year Ph.D student at Intent Lab in CMU Robotics Institute, advised by <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~abajcsy/">Prof. Andrea Bajcsy</a>. Previously, I am fortunate to work with <a href="https://davheld.github.io/">Prof. David Held</a> on generalizable methods for long-horizon contact-rich manipulation. 

Before coming to CMU, I was a master student with a focus on assistive feeding and bimanual manipulation in Computer Science Department at Stanford University, supervised by <a href="https://dorsa.fyi/">Prof. Dorsa Sadigh</a>. 

In the past, I am also fortunate to work with <a href="https://jxwuyi.weebly.com/">Prof. Yi Wu</a> from Tsinghua University at Shanghai Qi Zhi Institute on reinforcement learning and self-imitation. In my undergrad, I also worked closely with <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/">Prof. Pieter Abbeel</a> and <a href="https://www.lerrelpinto.com/">Prof. Lerrel Pinto</a> on reinforcment learning for deformable object manpulation.

My current research focuses on `open-world robot learning for manipulation` and `human-robot interaction`. My research centers around overcoming the fundamental <em>embodiment gap</em> that limits the application of foundation models to robotics. By grounding the high-level semantic reasoning in the continuous dynamic environment of the physical world, I want to build robots that can learn, reason and act capably in human-centered environment. My current work tries to enhance the robots' generalization and robustness with runtime alignment and continual learning. I am also broadly interested in developing various deep learning methods like reinforcement learning and imitation learning to enhance robot's capability for more complex manipulation tasks.
